GCC Toolchain for cross-compiling illumos on alternate architectures.

This toolchain is meant to be built and ran on an illumos-based distribution like OpenIndiana.

This is part of an effort to make Hayashi Naoyuki's Aarch64/RISCV64/ALPHA illumos port builable
from within a native illumos-based environment. The current port relies heavily on a Linux environment
(OpenSUSE 15.1) and is not currently self-hosting.

More details on Hayashi Naoyuki's illumos port can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/hayashin/illumos-gate/wiki/Home).
