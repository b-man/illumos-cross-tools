/*
 * Disk Management Library
 *
 * This library provides a common way to gather information about a system's
 * disks, controllers, and related components.
 *
 *
 * THREADS
 * -------
 *
 * In general all of the functions are thread safe, however there are some
 * specific considerations for getting events.  The dm_get_event function may
 * block the calling thread if no event is currently available.  If another
 * thread calls dm_get_event while a thread is already blocked in this function,
 * the second thread will also block.  When an event arrives and multiple
 * threads are waiting for events, it is undefined which thread will be
 * unblocked and receive the event.  If a callback is used for handling events,
 * this is equivalent to the dm_get_event function, so mixing callbacks and
 * dm_get_event is also nondeterministic.
 *
 *
 * ERRORS
 * ------
 *
 * In general all of the functions take an errno pointer.  This is an integer
 * that will contain 0 if the function succeeded or contains an errno (see
 * errno.h) if there was an error.  If the function returns some data, that
 * return data will generally be null if an error occured (see the API comment
 * for the specific function for details).  Many of the functions take a
 * descriptor and provide more information for that descriptor.  These functions
 * may return an error if the object was removed between the call which obtained
 * the descriptor and the call to get more information about the object (errno
 * will be ENODEV).  Only a few of the possible errno values will be returned;
 * typically:
 *     EPERM       not super-user
 *     ENOMEM      not enough memory
 *     ENODEV      no such device
 *     EINVAL      invalid argument
 *     ENOENT      no event queue has been created
 *
 * Many of the functions require the application to be running as root in order
 * to get complete information.  EPERM will be returned if the application is
 * not running as root.  However, not all of the functions have this requirement
 * (i.e. event handling).
 *
 * It is possible for the system to run out of memory while receiving events.
 * Since event receipt is asyncronous from the dm_get_event call there may not
 * be a thread waiting when the event occurs and ENOMEM is detected.  In this
 * case the event will be lost.  The first call to dm_get_event following this
 * condition will immediately return ENOMEM, even if events are queued.
 * Subsequent calls can return events.  The dm_get_event call will clear the
 * pending ENOMEM condition.  There is no way to know how many events were lost
 * when this situation occurs.  If a thread is waiting when the event arrives
 * and the ENOMEM condition occurs, the call will also return with ENOMEM.
 * There is no way to determine if the system ran out of memory before the
 * dm_get_event call or while the thread was blocked in the dm_get_event call
 * since both conditions cause dm_get_event to return ENOMEM.
 *
 *
 * MEMORY MANAGEMENT
 * -----------------
 *
 * Most of the functions that return data are returning memory that has been
 * allocated and must be freed by the application when no longer needed.  The
 * application should call the proper free function to free the memory.  Most of
 * the functions return either a nvlist or an array of descriptors.  The normal
 * nvlist function (nvlist_free; see libnvpair(3LIB)) can be used to free the
 * simple nvlists.  Other functions are provided to free the more complex data
 * structures.
 *
 * The following list shows the functions that return allocated memory and the
 * corresponding function to free the memory:
 *     dm_get_descriptors            dm_free_descriptors
 *     dm_get_associated_descriptors dm_free_descriptors
 *     dm_get_descriptor_by_name     dm_free_descriptor
 *     dm_get_name                   dm_free_name
 *     dm_get_attributes             nvlist_free
 *     dm_get_stats	          nvlist_free
 *     dm_get_event                  nvlist_free
 *
 *
 * EVENTS
 * ------
 *
 * Event information is returned as a nvlist.  It may be possible to return more
 * information about events over time, especially information about what has
 * changed.  However, that may not always be the case, so by using an nvlist we
 * have a very generic event indication.  At a minimum the event will return the
 * name of the device, the type of device (see dm_desc_type_t) and the type of
 * event.  The event type is a string which can currently be; add, remove,
 * change.
 *
 * If a drive goes up or down this could be returned as event type "change".
 * The application could get the drive information to see that the "status"
 * attribute has changed value (ideally the event would include an attribute
 * with the name of the changed attribute as the value).  Although the API can
 * return events for all drive related changes, events will not necessarily be
 * delivered for all changes unless the system generates those events.
 *
 *
 * Controller/HBAs
 * ---------------
 *
 * In general the API means "the parent node of the drive in the device tree"
 * where the word "controller" is used.  This can actually be either the HBA or
 * the drive controller depending on the type of the drive.
 *
 * Drives can be connected to their controller(s) in three different ways:
 *     single controller
 *     multiple controllers
 *     multiple controllers with mpxio
 * These cases will lead to different information being available for the
 * configuration.  The two interesting cases are multi-path with and without
 * mpxio.  With mpxio the drive will have a unique name and a single controller
 * (scsi_vhci).  The physical controllers, the paths to the drive, can be
 * obtained by calling dm_get_associated_descriptors with a drive descriptor and
 * a type of DM_PATH.  This will only return these physical paths when MPXIO, or
 * possibly some future similar feature, is controlling the drive.
 *
 * Without mpxio the drive does not have a unique public name (in all cases the
 * alias(es) of the drive can be determined by calling
 * dm_get_associated_descriptors to get the DM_ALIAS descriptors.  There will be
 * more than one controller returned from dm_get_associated_descriptors when
 * called with a type of DM_CONTROLLER.  The controllers for each of the aliases
 * will be returned in the same order as the aliases descriptors.  For example,
 * a drive with two paths has the aliases c5t3d2 and c7t1d0.  There will be two
 * controllers returned; the first corresponds to c5 and the second corresponds
 * to c7.
 *
 * In the multi-path, non-mpxio case the drive has more than one alias.
 * Although most of the drive attributes are represented on the drive (see
 * dm_get_attributes) there can be some different attributes for the different
 * aliases for the drive.  Use dm_get_associated_descriptors to get the DM_ALIAS
 * descriptors which can then be used to obtain these attributes.  Use of this
 * algorithm is not restricted to the multi-path, non-mpxio case.  For example,
 * it can be used to get the target/lun for a SCSI drive with a single path.
